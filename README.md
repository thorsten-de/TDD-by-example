# Test-driven Development by Example

This repository is my walk-trough for the seminal book by Kent Beck.

## Part I - The Money Example
This contains the tests and code examples from the first part
of the Book. I decided to code them in Rust to have some fun
with exploring the idiosyncraties of the Rust language while 
implementing a basic TDD approach. 

This is very easy as a testing framework is included in the 
core language tooling and unit tests are usually defined 
*inline* within the implementation files. 

During this part, I will sometimes commit code that is not
compiling, as this demonstrates the flow of TDD baby steps.
This is not recommended in a professional setting.
