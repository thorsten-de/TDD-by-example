# Test-driven Development by Example

This repository is my walk-through for the seminal book by Kent Beck.

## Part I - The Money Example

[The Money Example](./the-money-example/README.md) contains the tests and code examples from the first part
of the Book. During this part, I will sometimes commit code that is not
compiling, as this demonstrates the flow of TDD baby steps.
This is not recommended in a professional setting.

There is an additional implementation of the [Money Example in C#](/the-money-example-csharp/README.md). As it
turns out, there is quite a shift in paradigms between Rust and the original
code examples. To get a better feeling for the original solution, we first
implement it in C#.

## Part II - The xUnit Example

This example develops a testing framework in Python test-first. As this is a good opportunity
to refresh my rusty python skills, I'll follow the example to the letter in [The xUnit Example](./the-xUnit-example/README.md).
