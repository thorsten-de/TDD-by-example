# Test-driven Development by Example

This repository is my walk-trough for the seminal book by Kent Beck.

## Part I - The Money Example
[The Money Example](./the-money-example/README.md) contains the tests and code examples from the first part
of the Book. During this part, I will sometimes commit code that is not
compiling, as this demonstrates the flow of TDD baby steps.
This is not recommended in a professional setting.
