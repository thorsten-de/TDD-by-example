# The Money Example - C# implementation

This is an additional implementation of the Money Example from the TDD book.
We expect it to be quite straight-forward, as no paradigm shift is required.

## Progress

We track our progress with the following To-Do list:

- [ ] `$5 + 10 CHF = $10` if rate is `2:1`
- [x] `$5 * 2 = $10`
- [x] Make `Amount` private
- [x] Dollar side effects?
- [ ] Money rounding?
- [x] `Equals()`
- [ ] `GetHashCode()`
- [ ] Equal null
- [ ] Equal object
- [x] `5 CHF * 2 = 10 CHF`
- [ ] Dollar/Franc duplication
- [x] Common equals
- [ ] Common times
- [x] Compare Francs to Dollars
- [x] Currency?
- [ ] Delete tests for FrancMultiplication?
